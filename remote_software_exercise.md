2. Write a function accepting two string parameters returning `true` if the first parameter is a substring of the second.

  - `Parameter1 = “steven”, Parameter2 = 'stevenbrown’, Output = true`
  - `Parameter1 = “Steven”, Parameter2 = 'stevenbrown’, Output = false`
  - `Parameter1 = “steven”, Parameter2 = 'st3v3nbrown’, Output = false`
  - `Parameter1 = “steven”, Parameter2 = 'brownsteven’, Output = true`
  - Check that both Parameters have been provided;
  - Check that both Parameters are Strings;
  - Check that the length of the second Parameter is greater than or equal to the length of the first;
  - Create a copy of that function and change that copy in order to make it case insensitive.
